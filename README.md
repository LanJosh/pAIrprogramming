Hack str8 outta HackOHI/O 2016.

This helpful AI assistant listens to what you think the program should be 
like, learns it, then gives you a program it thinks should be.

It's like a pair programmer, only it's an AI. And it hates you.

A small Markov model is built from a set of valid Core programs so that
we have a legitimate grammer. This 10xer AI would never write programs that
can't compile. The user input program is added to the Markov model (the 
weight given to the input is dependent on the structure) then the AI 
generates a program for you to code review.
